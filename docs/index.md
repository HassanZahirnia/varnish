This library contains a set of UI widgets / components. They range from something as simple as a button, to as complex as a fully-featured Markdown-based text editor. Originally, these components were exclusively part of Lumeno's codebase, however they have since been extracted, extended and made available for MIT-licensed, open-source use.
