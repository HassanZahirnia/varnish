# Installation

To use Varnish in your project, first create a `package.json` file if you have not already done so. You can do this using NPM:

```bash
npm init
```

Next, you will need to install the library (also via NPM):

```bash
npm install @caneara/varnish
```

You can now begin using Varnish. Before diving in though, be sure to review the 'Getting Started' area of the documentation (especially the section on [fonts](/pages/fonts)).
